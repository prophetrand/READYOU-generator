## Acknowledgments
* [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) has been my go-to for descriptive tutorials on HTML, CSS, and Javascript syntax and best practices. I am eternally grateful for their massive store of documentation.
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is another resource for documentation on HTML, CSS, and Javascript that I find myself using more and more often as I work through deeper Javascript.
* [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) is an open source node package that I used to provide interactive command line prompts in this project.
